### A new start
So this is my first blog post. Hello world! 

I have worked some with a starter template and it is built in `GatsbyJS`. So this is static pages composed with markdown, and some `React` involved as well.

### So what's next?
I'm currently preparing some internal educational material to use within our company, and it involves preparing a few demoes. I diving in to Flow and PowerApps currently, so don't be surprised if I blog about some of the concepts.

### Why am I doing this?
I want try out blogging, I feel that it's a good way to collect my thoughts regarding the challenges I face in my work. It might be useful for anyone, and maybe I will remember the solutions better next time.

And I plan to start with real blog post quite soon.
