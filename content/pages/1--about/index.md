### Who am I?

My name is Simon Ågren. I'm a father of two awesome boys, and we live with our family in Umeå, Sweden. 
I work as a consultant at [Sogeti](http://www.sogeti.com) with primarily SharePoint, Office365 and Azure. Over the past few years I've worked a lot on the clienside with React, TypeScript, NodeJS, Angular etc...

### What is it about?

The blogging on this site is to share my own learnings as I go. I expect that will strengthen my understanding of subjects I will write about. I also hope that you find it helpful.

It will be both simple findings and maybe some more elaborate tutorials/instructions.
