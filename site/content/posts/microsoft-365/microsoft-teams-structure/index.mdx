In the previous post, I established that a team should always have a purpose and that purpose should have a structure. After going over considerations for groups, channels, and tabs structure, we will today talk about putting this all together in a templatized way - Microsoft Teams Templates.

# What are Teams Templates?
Microsoft Teams templates are the out-of-the-box options we have to build pre-built definitions of a team's structure. Teams Templates contain channels and tabs, but the tabs are referred to as "apps" in the templates.

# Base Templates vs. Custom templates
Microsoft provides pre-built team templates available in the Teams admin-center. Pre-built templates are templates that we created for specific industries (verticals) such as Healthcare or Education. Unfortunately, you can't edit these.
You can create your custom templates entirely from scratch, an existing team, and a pre-built template. However, please notice that you can't change some of the properties in the base templates.
 
# Manage Templates
You can create new templates from the Microsoft Teams admin center UI and set the team structure with channels, tabs, and apps. But you can't configure any of the teams-specific settings.
Instead, using the Teams PowerShell module, you can configure everything available in the Teams templates while creating a new template and during an update.


# From scratch


# From an existing team
Microsoft Teams lets you create a template from an existing team that can be saved and modified to meet your particular organizational needs.
