# Introduction

In this small post we will look at a scenario where we want to register an Azure AD Application using specific scopes. When adding scopes for service principals using the Azure CLI we need to use the internal Ids. And one way would be to manually create one registration, get that app and then print out the scopes and then just copy and paste. Where's the challenge in that?

# Prerequisites 
[Azure Cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [An Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

# Command overview
When we use the command [az ad app create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-app-create) and want to add permission scopes, we will need to use `--required-resource-accesses` and supply a json format where `resourceAppId` represents the service provider (ex. Microsoft Graph), and we need to add the scopes with ids in `resourceAccess`. And this is one example how it can look:
```json
[{
    "resourceAppId": "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
    "resourceAccess": [
        {
            "id": "a42657d6-7f20-40e3-b6f0-cee03008a62a",
            "type": "Scope"
        }
   ]
}]
```  

## List all available service providers
We use the command `az ad sp list` and ` --all` to get all service providers. We also add a query `--query "[].{Name:appDisplayName, Id:appId}`. The first brackets takes all the results, and then we use the `{}` to create an object with custom header names `appDisplayName` and the `appId` and output it as a table.

```json
az ad sp list --query "[].{Name:appDisplayName, Id:appId}" --output table --all
```

## Get Microsoft Graph from the service providers 
We use the same base command but change the query slightly `--query "[?appDisplayName=='Microsoft Graph'].{Name:appDisplayName, Id:appId}"`. Now in the first bracket we only look for a service provicer with the `appDisplayName` of Microsoft Graph and then we output the values in a table. 

```json
az ad sp list --query "[?appDisplayName=='Microsoft Graph'].{Name:appDisplayName, Id:appId}" --output table --all
```

## Use the service provider appId in a variable
You could ofcourse just copy the Id from the table we printed. But it could be really good to know how to work with variables. If you are runnign Azure CLI from PowerShell, like I am, this is an example to grab the Microsoft Graph service provider Id to a variable.

```json
$graphId = az ad sp list --query "[?appDisplayName=='Microsoft Graph'].appId | [0]" --all 
```
## Get the available application permissions
Here we change the command to `az ad sp show` which is used to get a specific service provider. In the query `--query "appRoles[].{Value:value, Id:id}"` we get all the `appRoles`, flatten them, and then select the value and id to output as a table.

```json
az ad sp show --id $graphId --query "appRoles[].{Value:value, Id:id}" --output table
```
## Get specific appRole to variable
We could also query for specific appRoles of course. We changed the query `--query "appRoles[?value=='Mail.Send'].id | [0]` to look for a specific appRole with the value equal to `Mail.Send`

```json
$mailSend = az ad sp show --id $graphId --query "appRoles[?value=='Mail.Send'].id | [0]" 
```

## Get the available delegated permissions
Here we continue with the same command but changed the query `--query "oauth2Permissions[].{Value:value, Id:id}"` to insted get `oauth2Permissions`, we flatten them and output value and id as a table.

```json
az ad sp show --id 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 --query "oauth2Permissions[].{Value:value, Id:id}" --output table
```

## Get specific delegated permissions to variable
We could do the same when getting a specific `--query "oauth2Permissions[?value=='openid'].id | [0]` to look for a specific delegated with the value equal to `openid`

```json
$openid = az ad sp show --id $graphId --query "oauth2Permissions[?value=='openid'].id | [0]" 
```


# Creating Azure AD Application registration

In this example we create an app registration that has permissions to Microsoft Graph and will be able to be utilized by a Bot.

1. Create variables for app name and password
  ```json
  $appName = "AADSimonBotGraphTest"
  $secret = "SimonBlogBotDemoStuff1!"
  $replyUrl = "https://token.botframework.com/.auth/web/redirect"
  ```


2. Get Microsoft Graph Id
  
  ```json
  $graphId = az ad sp list --query "[?appDisplayName=='Microsoft Graph'].appId | [0]" --all 
  ```

3. Create variables for scopes
  
  ```json
    $openid = az ad sp show --id $graphId --query "oauth2Permissions[?value=='openid'].id | [0]"

    $profile = az ad sp show --id $graphId --query "oauth2Permissions[?value=='profile'].id | [0]" 
  ```
4. Create JSON structure for resources

  In PowerShell you need to have the JSON as one string, without any new rows etc. And it also has to be escaped. That is why I added the last `ConvertTo-Json` which, in this case, escapes the double qoutes from `"` to `\"`.

  In more complex scenarios you might want to get a bit fancier with HOW you build the string, but the beginning `@"` and ending `@"` let's me use variables in the string. 

  You could as well put the JSON in a .json file and then use it. But it makes more sense when using hardcoded values.

  ```json
  $resources = @"
  [{ "resourceAppId": $graphId, "resourceAccess": [{"id": $openid,"type": "Role"},{"id": $profile,"type": "Role"}]}]
  "@ | ConvertTo-Json
  ```

5. Create the AD Application

Here we use the `az ad app create` and add in our variables that we created and the "scopes". And i this case we create a single tenant app.

```json
az ad app create --display-name $appName --password $secret --reply-urls $replyUrl --required-resource-accesses $resources --available-to-other-tenants false
```

6. (Optional) Admin consent

Try to stay away from scopes that require Admin consent. If you need to consent you could do this using this command with the `appId` you get after creation 

```json
az ad app permission admin-consent --id $appId 
```
