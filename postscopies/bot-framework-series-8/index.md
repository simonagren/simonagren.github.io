In the last post we had a look at proactive messages at a higher level, and implemented some token validation.

In this post we will have a look at using LUIS for natural language processing. The main goal is to give the Bot the ability to extract words from sentances and understand what we want to do.

## Prerequisites 

- Bot Emulator
- Node.js 10.4+
- Visual Studio Code
- An Azure Account (get one for free)
- Microsoft Teams
- Ngrok
